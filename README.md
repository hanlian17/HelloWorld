Shijie Han's code test repo.

## Introduction to Me(HSJ)
I'm a sophomore at HUST(Huazhong University of Science and Technology), interested in coding and algorithm. ML and image processing are what I want to research. Hoping to find someone in the same camp!

## Scientific Calculator
This repository now includes a small scientific calculator written in Python. Run it with:

```bash
./scientific_calculator.py "expression"
```

Or start an interactive session by running it without arguments.
